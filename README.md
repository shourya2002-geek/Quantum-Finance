# Algorithms in Quantum Finance

Quantum algorithms applied to a Portfolio Management problem.
Developed an improved version of the traditional QAOA algorithm that provides the following advantages:
- A huge speedup in execution time
- Sequential reduction of the state space to the set of feasible states
- Immense Possibility to add complex constraints that do not fit the penalty term model, such as, binary encoding and sector allocation.
